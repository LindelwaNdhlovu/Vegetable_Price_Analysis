## Project Overview

This project utilises a comprehensive data analysis process involving data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis techniques within Python's Jupyter Notebook. This project aims to gain insights into vegetable price data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on a wide range of vegetables, detailing vegetable prices recorded over a period of 12 months.

### Data Description
- **Date**: The date on which the price was recorded.
- **Vegetable**: The type of vegetable.
- **Price**: The price of the vegetable on the given date.

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ksamiksha19/vegetable-prices).


## Project Structure

The project is organised into the following sections within the Jupyter Notebook:
1. **Introduction**: Context and objective of the analysis.
2. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Steps taken to prepare the dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualisations and analysis of trends, patterns, and anomalies.
4. **Insights and Conclusions**: Summary of findings and recommendations.


## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

### Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Usage
Open the AnnualVeggiePrices.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to reproduce the analysis. The notebook is organized into clearly defined sections to guide you through the process.

## Contributions
